# The 13th Computational Neuroscience Winter School

**Jan. 15-20, 2024**

*Organized by [**Lab of computational neuroscience**](https://lcns-sjtu.github.io/), Shanghai Jiao Tong University*

---

## Introduction
This winter course provides 8 lectures in one week to introduce a variety of topics in the field of neuroscience and computational neuroscience. Studies of brain functions have focused on the information processing properties of individual neurons, neural circuits and network systems. Computational neuroscience seeks to study these functions as revealed by neurophysiological experiments through computational means, and, as such, is highly interdisciplinary. Our winter school brings together experimentalists, modelers, and theoreticians to illustrate the diverse approaches and disciplines that make up computational neuroscience.

The winter school is sponsored by the Chinese Neuroscience Society (Committee on Computational Neuroscience and Neural Engineering)，CSIAM Mathematical Life Sciences, the SJTU Institute of Natural Sciences, Ministry of Education-Key Lab in Scientific and Engineering Computing and the SJTU Zhiyuan College.

## Venue
Room 300, No. 5 Science Building, Minhang Campus, Shanghai Jiao Tong University


## Application and Registration
We will recruit 30 students in this winter school to keep a good instructor-student ratio. The selection is based on applicants’ background and research interests, and importantly, how they would potentially benefit from this winter school. Applicants from math, physics, computer science, engineering, biology, neuroscience and others are all welcome to apply. Please register online by December 24, 2023: https://jinshuju.net/f/G6EmYC

For faculty who are interested in attending some of these lectures, please contact us via email yyqjune@sjtu.edu.cn.

There is no registration fee for the winter school. All participants are responsible to their own travel, accommodation, food and beverage expenses.
